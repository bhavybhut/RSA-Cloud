1) First generate keys
javac KeyGeneration.java
java KeyGeneration

2) Start Listener using RSAReceiverDecrypt
javac RSAReceiverDecrypt.java
java RSAReceiverDecrypt

3) Now send data to receiver using RSASenderEncrypt
javac RSASenderEncrypt.java
java RSASenderEncrypt

NOTE: Run KeyGeneration, RSAReceiverDecrypt and RSASenderEncrypt on different terminals

Thank you. :)
